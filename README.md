# Development Machine Setup - Salt-Script
Every time I install a new Dev machine I have to setup a bunch of things and many times I miss things and they cause problem for setup. 
So this time when setting up my Dev Machine I have written salt-script which will enable set setup of the machine by role. 

Its a best effort and for now I am adding following features:
1. Install Odoo (v6 and v8)
2. Install Django projects
3. Install Eclypse and PyDev (may not be possible by script though). 
4. Install R and R Studio
5. Clone some git repos for work offline.
